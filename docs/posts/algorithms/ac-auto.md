# AC Multi-Pattern Searching Algorithm

[AC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aho%E2%80%93Corasick_algorithm) is a multi-pattern searching algorithm. For a
given set of pattern strings $S$, it pre-caculates a trie representing a state-machine for searching process. And
the time complexity is $O(\sum_{s \in S} |s|)$.
