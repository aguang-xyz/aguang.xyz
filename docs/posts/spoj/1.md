# SPOJ 1 - TEST - Life, the Universe, and Everything

Your program is to use the brute-force approach in order to find the Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything. More precisely... rewrite small numbers from input to output. Stop processing input after reading in the number 42. All numbers at input are integers of one or two digits.

## Example

```text
Input:
1
2
88
42
99

Output:
1
2
88
```

## Solution

It's just for familiarizing yourself with this website.

## Source Code

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {

  int element;

  while (scanf("%d", &element) != EOF) {
		
    if (42 == element) {
      break;
    }
    printf("%d\n", element);
  }
 
 return 0;
} 
```
